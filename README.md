# Covid-19 Forecast
The project utilized SQL skills for data analysis and Tableau for visualization to forecast COVID-19 infections until August 2023. 
By downloading data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths and creating two datasets for COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations which you find in file,
various SQL techniques such as Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types were applied for data analysis.

Then project resulted in the creation of four datasets with running queries to generate insights on total cases, total deaths, death percentage, 
total deaths per continent, percent population infected per country, and percent population infected for forecasting. 
These datasets were then visualized in a dashboard using Tableau, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the forecasted COVID-19 data.

The project has demonstrated the use of data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights and make forecasts regarding COVID-19 infections.
The findings from this project could be valuable for decision-makers in the healthcare and policy domains to better understand the trends and 
patterns of COVID-19 infections and make informed decisions accordingly.
